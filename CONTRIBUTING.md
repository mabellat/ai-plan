# Contributing
- Use feature branches and open PRs with a clear problem statement, design notes, and tests.
- Prefer small, composable modules and docstrings with minimal examples.
- Run `make dev` before pushing. Lint & typecheck must pass.
- Follow `docs/style-guide.md` for code, docs, and commit messages.
