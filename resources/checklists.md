# Checklists

## EDA & Data
- Leakage: time, target, identity.
- Missingness, outliers, duplicates.
- Split strategy and reproducibility.

## Training
- Seeds, determinism, checkpoints.
- Loss/metric sanity, baseline comparison.
- Overfitting watch: gap, early stop.

## RAG
- Chunking, overlap, metadata.
- Retrieval recall@k, reranker quality.
- Faithfulness eval & trace logging.

## Agents
- Tool whitelists, permissioning.
- Retry/backoff, idempotency.
- Cost caps, killâ€‘switch.
