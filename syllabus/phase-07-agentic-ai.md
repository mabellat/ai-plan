# Phase 7 — Agentic AI (Weeks 45–52)

## Architectures & Patterns
- ReAct, Reflexion, Toolformer, AutoGPT‑style loops, Voyager, Graph‑of‑Thoughts.
- Task decomposition & planning: BFS/DFS planners, LLM planners, hierarchical controllers.
- Memory: episodic, semantic, vector & symbolic stores; retrieval‑augmented memory; pruning/aging.
- Tool use: structured tool schemas; function calling; grounding; verification.
- Multi‑agent: roles, protocols, blackboard/bus; emergent behavior; safety constraints.
- Scheduling & orchestration: LangGraph; state machines; retries/backoff; idempotency.

## Evaluation & Safety
- Agent evals: success@K, path length, tool efficiency, correctness, side‑effects.
- Safety: permissioning, capability whitelists, sandboxing, rate‑limits, cost caps, data privacy.

## Deliverables
- Build: A production‑style agent with tools (web, code-runner, vector mem) + eval harness.
- Design doc: escalation policies, observability, kill‑switches, red‑team tests.
