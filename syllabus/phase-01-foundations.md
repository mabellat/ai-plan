# Phase 1 — Foundations (Weeks 1–8)

## Math Refresh
- Linear algebra: vectors, norms, dot products, projections; matrix rank, null space; eigenvalues/eigenvectors; SVD, PCA.
- Calculus: limits, derivatives, gradients; chain rule; Taylor; Jacobians/Hessians; optimization intuition.
- Probability & Stats: random variables, PDFs/PMFs, expectations; Bayes’ rule; covariance/correlation; CLT; hypothesis tests; confidence intervals.
- Information theory: entropy, cross‑entropy, KL, mutual information.

## Programming & Software Engineering
- Python essentials: typing, dataclasses, packaging; virtualenv/poetry; logging; CLI with `typer`.
- Data stack: NumPy broadcasting, vectorization; pandas indexing/joins/groupby; I/O (Parquet/CSV/Arrow); plotting with matplotlib.
- CS tools: data structures (heaps, graphs), complexity; iterators/generators; async/await basics.
- Tooling: git branching, PR reviews, code style (ruff+black), mypy, pytest, pre‑commit.

## Data Literacy
- Data profiling, schema evolution, missingness; EDA checklists; leakage traps; reproducibility.

## Deliverables
- Notebook: Linear algebra mini‑lab (PCA from scratch).
- CLI: `datasanity` — quick EDA & data validation checks.
- Mini‑project: Kaggle‑scale supervised task with solid validation.
