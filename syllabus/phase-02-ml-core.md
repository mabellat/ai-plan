# Phase 2 — ML Core (Weeks 9–16)

## Supervised Learning
- Regression: OLS, ridge/lasso; diagnostics; robust losses (Huber).
- Classification: logistic, softmax; calibration; class imbalance; metrics (ROC-AUC, PR-AUC).
- SVMs: margins, kernels; when to use in 2025.
- Trees & Ensembles: CART, RF, XGBoost/LightGBM; feature importance pitfalls.

## Un/Semi‑supervised & Feature Engineering
- Clustering (k‑means, GMM, spectral), dimensionality reduction (PCA, t‑SNE, UMAP).
- Feature pipelines: target leakage, scaling, encoders; feature stores concept.

## Evaluation & Experimentation
- Cross‑val, nested CV; ablations; reproducibility; A/B tests foundations.

## Deliverables
- Library: `mltoolkit` with data splits, metrics, CV, and experiment tracker wrappers.
- Project: Tabular SOTA benchmark replication with thorough ablations.
