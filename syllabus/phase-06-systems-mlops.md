# Phase 6 — Systems, Data & (LL)MLOps (Weeks 37–44)

## Data Engineering for ML
- Batch vs streaming; lakehouse basics; Parquet/Arrow/Delta; partitioning & z‑order; data contracts.
- Data validation: Great Expectations; drift & quality monitors.

## Experimentation & Repro
- Tracking: MLflow; experiment taxonomy; metrics/params/artifacts.
- Model registry; feature stores; lineage (DVC).

## Deployment
- Patterns: batch, online, streaming, hybrid; serverless vs long‑running; canary & shadow.
- Serving LLMs: CPU/GPU, quantization, vLLM/TPU notes; autoscaling; cost guardrails.

## LLMOps specifics
- Prompt/version management; eval harness (static/dynamic); safety filters & PII scrubbers.
- Observability: traces, tokens, latency tail, prompt drift.
- Governance: audit trails, policy engines, privacy/threat modeling.

## Deliverables
- Infra mini‑stack: Prefect + MLflow + DVC demo with a small model.
- Runbook: SLOs, on‑call playbooks, incident taxonomy for LLM features.
